<p>This is an Alx software engineering project.</p>
<p>We were tasked to create a simple command line interpreter that works just like the bash shell</p>
<p>We built a replica of some of the built-in functions like env, exit, setenv, unsetenv, help...</p>
<p>This shell can interpret chain and piped commamds</p>
To use this simple shell, compile all files using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *c -o hsh
