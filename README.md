This is an Alx software engineering project. 
We were tasked to create a simple command line interpreter that works just like the bash shell
We built a replica of some of the built-in functions like env, exit, setenv, unsetenv, help...
This shell can interpret chain and piped commamds
To use this simple shell, compile all files using gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *c -o hsh
